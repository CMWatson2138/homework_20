# cats_final tutorial

**cats_final tutorial script**

This is a brief instructional tutorial explaining how to run the cats_final.py program from the command line.  

First, start the terminal.  

Second, navigate to the folder containing the cats_final.py.  In this instance the folder is C:\Users\watso\Documents\Data_Science_Bootcamp\homework_20.  

Next type in the following into the command line behind the $ python cats_final.py

The program will run and the output will be shown in the terminal.

I think this excercise will be helpful in NLP because it is likely that not every machine we will work on will use jupyter notebook, but every machine will have access to a command line interface.
